rgr.csv= Sapling Growth and Health Dataset (rgr)
This dataset ('rgr') provides information on sapling growth and health. The dataset includes the following columns:

1. **Treatment:** The type of treatment applied to the saplings.
2. **Village:** The village where the observations were recorded.
3. **Site:** The specific site within the village where saplings were monitored.
4. **Species:** The species of saplings being studied.
5. **Disturbance:** The presence or absence of disturbances affecting saplings.
6. **rgrH:** A metric representing sapling growth (height measured in m).
7. **rgr_rcd:** Another metric related to sapling growth (rcd= root collar diameter, measured in cm).
8. **sap_health:** The health status of saplings (based on browsing, trampling and water stress).

**rgr** is used to make __sap_status__, which later used to create binary variables indicating the presence of specific disturbances and __com.species__ to make a df for common species with more than five individuals.
